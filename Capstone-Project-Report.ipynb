    "**Hotel Franchise A** decides to open a hotel in Bandung, Indonesia. Before beginning the construction, they want to analyze which part of the town the hotel should be built. A survey is deployed to the board of commissioners and other relevant stakeholders. The first and most important criterion that they want is that the hotel is located to as many point-of-interests/attractions as possible. Therefore, the analysis of neighborhood venues is necessary to be performed"
